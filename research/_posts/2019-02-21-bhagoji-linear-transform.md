# Abstract

We propose the use of data transformations as a
defense against evasion attacks on ML classifiers. We present
and investigate strategies for incorporating a variety of data
transformations including dimensionality reduction via Principal
Component Analysis and data ‘anti-whitening’ to enhance the
resilience of machine learning, targeting both the classification
and the training phase. We empirically evaluate and demonstrate
the feasibility of linear transformations of data as a defense
mechanism against evasion attacks using multiple real-world
datasets. Our key findings are that the defense is (i) effective
against the best known evasion attacks from the literature,
resulting in a two-fold increase in the resources required by
a white-box adversary with knowledge of the defense for a
successful attack, (ii) applicable across a range of ML classifiers,
including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks,
and (iii) generalizable to multiple application domains, including
image classification and human activity classification.
