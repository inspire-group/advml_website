## Purpose

This website designed as an open science showcase for recent work from the Bedford Lab.  We have a [blog](/blog/) for news and smaller analyses, but also [project pages](/projects/) that mirror ongoing research developments that take place on [GitHub](https://github.com/blab).  This structure is meant to make sharing of results as frictionless as possible, with the idea of having a GitHub repo that contains everything of key importance to a project.  Within this GitHub repo, `README.md` files or other Markdown files describe methods and results and such files get copied over to [projects/](/projects/), where we've attempted to streamline navigation.  So, reading the basics of a project can be done from the site, but if someone wants to really dive in, all the source code, data files, etc... are available from GitHub.

## Source code

All source code that's necessary to construct the site is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter).  All code is placed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blab/blotter#license). You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, but I would very much appreciate attribution and a link back to [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) from your `about` page.
